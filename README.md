    2) Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    3) The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    4) The total stock volume of the stock. 
    5) Returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
    6) Runs the analysis on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
    7) use conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.
